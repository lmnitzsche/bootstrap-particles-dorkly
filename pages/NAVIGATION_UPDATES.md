## üéØ How It Works

### Category Filtering From Navigation:
1. User clicks "Gaming" (or any category) in top navigation
2. Page smoothly scrolls down to Latest Articles section
3. Category pill for "Gaming" becomes active
4. Articles are filtered to show only Gaming content
5. If no articles in that category, shows friendly "No articles yet" message

### Button Improvements:
**Before:**
- Simple flat blue background
- Basic text with small icon
- No depth or visual interest

**After:**
- Gradient background (blue or purple/pink)
- Soft glow shadow effect
- Lifts up on hover with stronger glow
- Filled circle icon for better visibility
- Text wrapped in span for better control

## üì± Responsive Behavior

- Navigation category links are desktop-only (`d-none d-md-flex`)
- Mobile users still have category pills below hero section
- Buttons work perfectly on all screen sizes
- Smooth scroll animation works on mobile and desktop
